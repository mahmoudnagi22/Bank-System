I've built a simple banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with dart language, featuring options for:

. create a bank account
. list all the available bank accounts
. display account info 
. checking balance
. withdraw money
. deposit money
. delete account
. Exiting the program.

This project demonstrates my understanding of OOP principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
